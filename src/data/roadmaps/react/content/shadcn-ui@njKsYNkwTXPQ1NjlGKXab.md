# Shadcn UI

It is Accessible. Customizable. Open Source collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
_The Nice part is you do not need to install anything as dependency(do not need for npm install ...); you pick components you need from their website and copy their code for it and paste into your project_.

PS. I guess you need very basic info about TailwindCSS.
